NOTE: Change `<username>` with your supercomputing account name.

## Login 

OSCER has 2 login nodes, if you don't specify which of the two, then it will automatically chose on for you.

```
ssh <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu    # Auto
```
```
ssh <username>@schooner1.oscer.ou.edu   # Login Node 1
```
```
ssh <username>@schooner2.oscer.ou.edu   # Login Node 2
```  
<br />

## Submitting Jobs

To submit jobs to the SLURM scheduler, use `sbatch` followed by the name of your batch script.

```
sbatch script.slurm
```
<br />

### SLURM flags

| Option                  | Meaning |
| :-----                  | :------ |
| \--partition=NAME       | Job to run on partition "NAME" |
| \--time=HH:MM:SS        | Amount of wall time requested for job (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) | 
| \--nodes=#              | Number of nodes to use |
| \--ntasks=#             | Number of tasks (processors) to be run |
| \--cpus\-per\-task=#    | Number of CPUs required for each task (e.g. '8' for an 8-way multithreaded job) |
| \--ntasks\-per\-core=1  | Do not use hyperthreading (this flag typically used for parallel jobs) | 
| \--mem=#g               | Memory required for the job (Note the g (GB) in this option) |
| \--exclusive            | Allocate the node exclusively |
| \--error=%j.err         | JOBID as name of stderr file (by default, slurm######.out in the submitting directory) | 
| \--output=%j.out        | JOBID as name of stdout file (by default, slurm######.out in the submitting directory) | 
| \--job\-name=NAME       | Name your job, "NAME", so you can identify it in the queue |
| \--array=0-#            | Mechanism for submitting and managing similar jobs (# can be index values) |

### Example

Example of debug batch script.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --mem=1g
#SBATCH --output=%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%j.err
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --job-name=example
```
<br />

## Checking SLURM queue 

Shows all jobs running/pending in queue.

```
squeue 
```
<br />
Show *your* jobs that are running/pending in queue.

```
squeue -u <username> 
```
<br />
Find running/pending jobs for a specific partition.

```
squeue -p <ParitionName>
```
<br />

## Get Node information

List nodes.

```
sinfo
```
<br />
Find all available nodes.

```
sinfo | grep "idle"
```
<br />
Find information on why a specific node is down

```
sinfo -R
```
<br />

## Download Files/Folders

There are 2 options to downloading files and folders.

1. Download with `scp` (Good for small and/or few files/folders) 
    - For files, you will need to be in a second terminal where the _working directory is on your local computer_ and where you want the file to be located
    - For Folders, follow the previous step, and add the flag `scp -r`.
2. Download with `rsync` (For copying large amounts of data, and generally the preferred approach).
    - If a lot of data needs to be transfered it is also preferred to use the data transfer login node on OSCER (dtn2.oscer.ou.edu).
    - Same approach as `scp` but use the flags `rsync -avuim`.
    - `-a` archive - preserve as most of the data.
    - `-v` verbose - print summary of file transfer.
    - `-u` update - only newest file will be kept.
    - `-i` itemize - list of the changes.
    - `-m` prune - delete empty folders.

```
scp <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/file .               # File Download
```
```
scp <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/directory .          # Folder Download
```
<br />
```
rsync -avuim <username>@dtn2.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/file .      # File Download
```
```
rsync -avuim <username>@dtn2.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/directory . # Folder Download
```
<br />

## Uploading Files/Folders

The commands `scp` and `rsync` also uploads files and folders, just switch the [source] and [destination].

```
scp file <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/file                  # File Upload
```
```
scp directory <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/directory        # Folder Upload
```
<br />
```
rsync -avuim file <username>@dtn2.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/file         # File Upload
```
```
rsync -avuim folder <username>@dtn2.oscer.ou.edu:/path/to/directory  # Folder Upload
```
<br />

## Linux/Mac

If your OS is Linux/Mac, login is straight forward (`<username>` is your username): 

```
ssh <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu 
```
<br />

### Login with no password

On your computer, run the following:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
<br />

**NOTE:** Do not set a passphrase when creating the key (Press enter 3 times). Make sure that this file is only readable by you! The public key file (id_dsa.pub or id_rsa.pub) as the name implies can be uploaded to other systems to which you would like passwordless access.

Now, create a `~/.ssh` directory on the cluster (doesn't matter if this is already there).

```
ssh <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu mkdir -p .ssh
```
<br />

Append the public key to the cluser and enter password one last time:

```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@schooner.oscer.ou.edu `cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
```
<br />

## Windows

If your OS is Windows and you need to SSH to a remote server, you have 2 options:

1. SSH with Windows Powershell (**REQ:** Windows 10, Powershell 5.1+, Adminstrative Access).
2. SSH with PuTTy.

### SSH with Windows Powershell ###

**Prerequsite Checklist**

Open Powershell and Run as Administrator.

Run winver.exe and press enter to see the version details for your Windows device.

```
$ winver.exe
```
<br />
Run $PSVersionTable.PSVersion. Verify your major version is at least 5, and your minor version at least 1. Learn more about installing PowerShell on Windows.

```
$ PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```
<br />
Run the command below. The output will show True when you're a member of the built-in Administrators group.

```
$ (New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
```
<br />
