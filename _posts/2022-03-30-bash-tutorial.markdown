Are you ready? Because, I'm about to change your world!!!! 

This post is dedicated to developing your skills in usage of the command line interface. While it can be overwhelming at first, like any programming language, it takes a little practice and getting use to.

This tutorial will breakdown as followed: 
1) Basic Usage - Covers how to nagivate between directories (folders), copy/paste, move, and rename files.
2) Other Uses - Other commmand line functions that I found useful in Molecular Dynamics and Bio/Chem-informatics.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
