Are you ready? Because, I'm about to change your world!!!! 

This post is dedicated to developing your skills in usage of the command line interface. Like any programming language, it will be overwhelming at first and will take a little practice and getting use to. My goal for this tutorial is for you to be comfortable with basic syntax, and eventually develop your own scripts to start automating your tasks (no one likes repetitive tasks, right?). To do that, I will break the tutorial into 3 sections. In the first section, Basic Usage, you will learn how to navigate around the Terminal/Linux command line with Bash (more info on this later~). The second section, Advanced Usage, will cover scripting, loops, and other "advanced" features (Quotes on advanced because I don't like differentiating between basic and advanced uses, but for the tutorial's sake *sigh*). The last section, Other Uses, will cover other command line functions that I found useful from scripting for Molecular Dynamics simulations and Bio/Chem-informatics.    

Feel free to refer back to this page as you go on.

# Background #
Briefly, the command shell is just a program that takes in text commands, passes this information to your computer, and runs them. There are a few different flavors of command shells, such as bash, csh, ksh, DOS (Windows), etc. Although there are some overlap between the languages, each may contain their own special syntax for specific functions. If you're ever in doubt, you can find which flavor you're using by running the following command on your Terminal. Then Google your shell name + "cheat sheet" (Ex: "bash cheat sheet"), and looking at images. 

{% highlight ruby %}
$ echo $SHELL
{% end highlight %}

This should return something like:

{% highlight ruby %}
/bin/bash
{% end highlight %}


Personally, I use bash, and the following tutorial will be tailored towards that. If you would like to change your shell, run the following command in your Terminal.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
