I"üC<p>Are you ready? Because, I‚Äôm about to change your world!!!!</p>

<p>This post is dedicated to developing your skills in usage of the command line interface. Like any programming language, it will be overwhelming at first and will take a little practice and getting use to. My goal for this tutorial is for you to be comfortable with basic syntax, and eventually develop your own scripts to start automating your tasks (no one likes repetitive tasks, right?). To do that, I will break the tutorial into 3 sections. In the first section, Basic Usage, you will learn how to navigate around the Terminal/Linux command line with Bash (more info on this later~). The second section, Advanced Usage, will cover scripting, loops, and other ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù features (Quotes on advanced because I don‚Äôt like differentiating between basic and advanced uses, but for the tutorial‚Äôs sake <em>sigh</em>). The last section, Other Uses, will cover other command line functions that I found useful from scripting for Molecular Dynamics simulations and Bio/Chem-informatics.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: Example code will be shown in cells, where the ‚Äú$‚Äù (dollar sign) represents the input command. Cells without the ‚Äú$‚Äù (dollar sign) will represent output of said command. This is because the command shell will tell you what type of user you are when you‚Äôre logged into the command line environment. The dollar sign represents normal user.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When coding, naming files/folders should be descriptive. This often requires us to use multiple words separated by a space such as: blue sky, red ball, etc. While naming files/folders can include spaces, we often separate them by dashes (-) or underscores (<strong>). This is because names containing spaces require quotes when calling them through commmand line. In this tutorial, I will use underscores (</strong>).</p>

<p>Briefly, the command shell is just a program that takes in text commands, passes this information to your computer, and runs them. There are a few different flavors of command shells, such as bash, csh, ksh, DOS (Windows), etc. Although there are some overlap between the languages, each may contain their own special syntax for specific functions. If you‚Äôre ever in doubt, you can find which flavor you‚Äôre using by running the following command on your Terminal. Then Google your shell name + ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù (Ex: ‚Äúbash cheat sheet‚Äù), and look at images.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="vg">$SHELL</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This should return something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="sr">/bin/</span><span class="n">bash</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Personally, I use bash, and the following tutorial will be tailored towards that. If you would like to change your shell, run the following command in your Terminal.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">chsh</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="sr">/bin/</span><span class="n">bash</span></code></pre></figure>

<h1 id="basic-usage-part-1a">Basic Usage Part 1A</h1>
<p>Once again open your terminal (if you closed it), and you should see that you‚Äôre logged into the command line environment with your account name and a dollar sign. The first command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> stands for Print Working Directory, which will tell you were you are currently located in your system. Two examples are shown, one is on my local macbook, and the other is on my supercomputing account.</p>

<p>NOTE: Typically, your shell will always start at your default home location (if this is a new window that is opened for your terminal). Your home is usually set when you first made an account, and should have access to folders such as, Desktop, Documents, Pictures, etc.</p>

<h2 id="pwd">pwd</h2>
<p>pwd (print working directory) - outputs (prints) the location of your current working directory.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">pwd</span> </code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="sr">/Users/</span><span class="n">van</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>Question: What do you do if you need to find your homework file on your computer? Usually, I would have the file saved to some course folder, and I would have to navigate the Finder app to get to Documents, and then course folder. To do the same thing in terminal, you‚Äôll need to run a command called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. This command will list all files and folders in your current directory (You will use this command all the time!). Because this command will vary depending on the user, I will not have an example output, but you should see folders represented by blue text, and files represented by white text.</p>

<h2 id="ls">ls</h2>
<p>ls (list) - lists file/folders in current directory.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ls</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>Let‚Äôs make a new folder called ‚Äútest_1‚Äù for us to work in. The command will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> which stands for make directory. What follows the command will the folder‚Äôs name. This command is the same as right-clicking on your Desktop, and creating a new folder. Please be aware that folder names cannot have spaces. For example, if we wanted to name our folder, ‚Äútest 1‚Äù, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> command will recognize this as making two folders, one ‚Äútest‚Äù, and the second ‚Äú1.‚Äù Because of this, you often see most files/folders with a ‚Äú-‚Äú (hyphen) or ‚Äú_‚Äù (underscore).</p>

<p>If you run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command, you‚Äôll see your new folder ‚Äútest_1.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="mkdir">mkdir</h2>
<p>mkdir (make directory) - makes a new folder.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">mkdir</span> <span class="n">test_1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To go into a folder, we will run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> stands for change directory. This is the same as double clicking a folder on your Desktop, or file to open. Once you hit enter, you should see that the dollar sign reset, and you‚Äôre able to run your next command.</p>

<p>To check whether or not we are in the folder, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>. The new output should look like mine with the exception of the username.</p>

<h2 id="cd">cd</h2>
<p>cd (change directory) - allows you to enter a directory (folder).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">test_1</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">pwd</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="sr">/Users/</span><span class="n">van</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">test_1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To go out a folder, we will still use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, but rather than typing a folder name, we will use two periods.</p>

<p>Again, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> to check whether or not you left the ‚Äútest_1‚Äù folder. Your output from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> should again be like our first example of the command.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">..</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">pwd</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Going back into the ‚Äútest_1‚Äù folder, we are now going make a file. While there are a few ways to make files, I want to start with the harder method first (Not necessarily difficult, but takes a lot of getting use to). I will only cover the basics of Vim, while leaving the more fun stuff in <a href="#other-uses">Other Uses</a>.</p>

<p>We will use a text editor called Vim, which you could say is similar with Notepad, etc. The command to run Vim is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vi</code> following with the file name and file data type. We will make a text file called ‚Äútest.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="vim">vim</h2>
<p>vim - text editor (makes, edits files).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">vi</span> <span class="nb">test</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">txt</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This should take you to an empty page. To start editing the file, we will press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> key. Notice that the lower left hand corner of your screen shows that you are now in editing mode.</p>

<p>Type ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù into the editor.</p>

<p>Once written, save the file by pressing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esc</code> key, and typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:wq</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esc</code> key will allow you to exit editing mode, which should change the lower left hand corner of the screen again. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:wq</code> tells vim to save (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code> - write) and quit (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code>). More functions of Vim will be shown in <a href="#other-uses">Other Uses</a>.</p>

<p>Now you have a new file called ‚Äútext.txt‚Äù in your folder ‚Äútest_1‚Äù.</p>

<h1 id="basic-usage-part-1b">Basic Usage Part 1B</h1>

<p>At this point, we can start learning how to copy/paste, move, and  rename files/folders!</p>

<p>To copy files, we will use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command. The format of the operation follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cp</span> <span class="no">FILE1</span> <span class="no">FILE2</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>It‚Äôs also important to know that you don‚Äôt have to be in your working directory. FILE1 and FILE2 can point to the location you want to copy. Say that you want to copy the file back one folder it would look like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cp</span> <span class="no">FILE1</span> <span class="o">..</span><span class="sr">/FILE2 </span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="cp">cp</h2>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cp</span> <span class="nb">test</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">txt</span> <span class="n">test2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">txt</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You should see that you have two text file copies. If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> on both files, they should contain the same information.</p>

<p>To copy a folder we need to add a flag with to the copy command, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp -r</code>. Flags allow you to modify the operation of the command, in the case of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp -r</code>, we want to ‚Äú<strong>c</strong>o<strong>p</strong>y folde<strong>r</strong>‚Äù. In this example, we will copy the folder test_1. To do so, we‚Äôll need to change directories out one folder.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">..</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cp</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="n">test_1</span> <span class="n">test_2</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The next command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>, which can both move folders and rename! To move a folder, you will specify the folder you want to move, and then the location you want to move the file/folder too. Unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> which requires the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code> flag to specify folder, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> will work on both files/folders. As an example, we‚Äôll make a new folder called ‚Äúnew_directory‚Äù, and move test_2 to it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">mv</span> <span class="no">FOLDER1</span> <span class="no">FOLDER2</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="mv">mv</h2>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">mkdir</span> <span class="n">new_directory</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">mv</span> <span class="n">test_2</span> <span class="n">new_directory</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> your current directory, you should see that test_2 is no longer there, and that a new folder is made. If you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into ‚Äúnew_directory‚Äù, you should see that test_2 is there, along with the contents of the folder (test2.txt).</p>

<p>Now as a recep, we‚Äôve learned to navigate our computer via the command line with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, look at and make files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vi</code>, copy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code>, and move/rename files/folders <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>. The last commmand for this short introduction is deleting files/folders. Similar to copying, if we want to remove a folder, we‚Äôll need to add a ‚Äú-r‚Äù flag. First, we will delete a file in the ‚Äúnew_directory folder.‚Äù Then we‚Äôll delete the ‚Äútest_1‚Äù folder.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="no">FILENAME</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>or</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="no">FOLDERNAME</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="rm">rm</h2>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">new_directory</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="n">test2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">txt</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ls</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">..</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="n">test_1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This conclude the introduction and basic usage of command line! There are tons of other commands that can be learned to help you achieve whatever goal you need, but everything I‚Äôve shown you today should get you started with command line. Thank you for following!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in more advanced usage, you can move on to Part 2 of the tutorial!</p>
